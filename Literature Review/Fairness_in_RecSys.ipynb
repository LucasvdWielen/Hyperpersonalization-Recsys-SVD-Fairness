While enforcing demographic parity can reduce biases in job recommendations (Feldman et al., 2015), it may lower the modelâ€™s ability to optimize for relevance, affecting user satisfaction. Similarly, exposure fairness may help underrepresented creators gain visibility but could lower engagement on content platforms (Singh & Joachims, 2018). Beyond trade-offs, practical challenges include measuring fairness at scale, defining fairness in diverse global markets, and addressing data sparsity issues in cold-start scenarios. Moreover, fairness interventions may require compliance with regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, which imposes constraints on algorithmic decision-making in high-risk domains."
