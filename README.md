# Fairness Evaluation in Recommender Systems

This project investigates the fairness of recommender systems by implementing, evaluating, and comparing multiple collaborative filtering models on two real-world datasets: **MovieLens 100K** and **Yelp**.

We build three personalized recommendation models — **SVD++**, **UserKNN**, and **ItemKNN** — and evaluate them based on both **predictive accuracy (RMSE)** and a comprehensive set of **fairness metrics**. These metrics assess how the models treat users across sensitive attributes, focusing primarily on **gender**.

## Goals

- Implement and tune multiple recommendation algorithms
- Evaluate model performance using RMSE
- Assess fairness using both individual and group-level metrics
- Compare model behavior across datasets and demographic groups

## Datasets Used

- **Yelp Open Dataset**  
  Used for fairness evaluation with gender as the only sensitive attribute available.

- **MovieLens 100K**  
  Includes demographic information like age and gender. Used for all model training, testing, and fairness evaluation.
  
## Datasets needed for this EDA_&_FairnessMetrics.ipynb:

- `archive.zip`  
  Zipped version of the MovieLens dataset (raw source).

- `movielens_data/`  
  Unzipped folder containing the MovieLens dataset files (e.g., ratings, users, movies). 

- `itemknn_predictions.csv`  
  Contains predicted and actual ratings generated by the ItemKNN model.

- `svdpp_predictions.csv`  
  Contains predicted and actual ratings generated by the SVD++ model.

- `userknn_predictions.csv`  
  Contains predicted and actual ratings generated by the UserKNN model.
  
  ## Datasets needed for this SVD++Movielens_100k.ipynb, knn_user_movielens.ipynb, user_knn_movielens.ipynb:
  
  - `df_full.csv`  
  Preprocessed dataset combining ratings and user/item metadata.
